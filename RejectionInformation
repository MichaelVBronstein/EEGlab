%To use: load a processed_bin.set file into EEGlab, then run.
%What it does:
%Identify the channels which were rejected in each rejected epoch. Also
%identify the channels which caused epochs to be rejected most frequently
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
RejectionData = {}; %RejectionData structure contains list of chans causing rejection by epoch
CausedRejections = {}; %lists number of times each channel cause an epoch to be rejected in the dataset
RejectedChannels = [];

%identify epoch numbers which were rejected:
EpochNumbersRejected = sum(EEG.reject.rejmanualE);
EpochNumbersRejected = find(EpochNumbersRejected >= 1);

%find out what channel numbers in each of these epochs was rejected:
for NumberOfRejectedEpochs = 1:length(EpochNumbersRejected)
ChannelsCausingRejection = find(EEG.reject.rejmanualE(:,EpochNumbersRejected(NumberOfRejectedEpochs)) > 0);
RejectionData.(strcat('epochnumber',int2str(EpochNumbersRejected(NumberOfRejectedEpochs)))) = ChannelsCausingRejection; 
for NumberOfRejectedChannels = 1:length(ChannelsCausingRejection)
RejectedChannels(1,end+1) = ChannelsCausingRejection(NumberOfRejectedChannels);
end
end

%find out what channels were the most commonly causing rejection:
for NumberOfChannels = 1:length(EEG.chanlocs)
    CausedRejections.(strcat('Chan',int2str(NumberOfChannels))) = {sum(RejectedChannels == NumberOfChannels)}; 
end
