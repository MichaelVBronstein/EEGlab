%  Subtracts ALLERP set one from ALLERP set two in order to create a
%  difference wave between two ERP sets. This is useful if you have separate ERPs for pre/post treatment data and want to make a difference wave

  ERP1.bindata(:,:,NumberOfBins) = ERP1.bindata(:,:,NumberOfBins) - ALLERP(2).bindata(:,:,NumberOfBins); %bin 1 is now bin 1 set 1 - bin 1 set 2...
