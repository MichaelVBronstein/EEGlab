EEGlab

Functions compatible with EEGlab (useful for conducting EEG/ERP research)

Note that these RT getting functions will only work if you have only 2 event codes in each trial of your data. For more complicated studies involving multiple event-codes, use only the reaction time function UniversalRTs from this depository (the others are based on EEGlab functions that assume 2 event codes/epoch).
